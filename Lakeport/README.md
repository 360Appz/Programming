# WPF MVVM App

## Description
This WPF application demonstrates the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) model for switching views in an app. This app is named LakePort as it connects different views across the app. Hence, **port** which is used to connect things and **lake** to represent vastness. This view model type can be scaled for larger projects. Finally, MVVM models are widely used in GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications.

#### Why MVVM
 * A software architectural pattern for GUI-based apps
 * Helps to separate business logic/back-end code
 * This helps the various views to be independent of the back-end code. In addition, it leads to decoupling which is part of the      object-oriented programming paradigm.

## Demo
